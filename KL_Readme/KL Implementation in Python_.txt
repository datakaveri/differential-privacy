K-Anonymity and L-Diversity Implementation in Python:


Libraries Used:
* pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
* numpy: For numerical operations.
Functions:
* isKAnonymized:
   * Checks K-anonymity and L-diversity conditions in a partition.
* get_spans:
   * Calculates spans of each column in a partition.
* split:
   * Splits a partition based on median or all categories.
   * For numerical columns, we take the median of all the values and split the dataset into half based on median.
   * For categorical column, we split dataset to n partitions, where n is number of categories in categorical column.
* partition_dataset:
   * Partitions dataset based on K-anonymity and L-diversity.
   * Iteratively splits based on categorical and numerical columns.
   * Merges categories not satisfying K-anonymity.
   * Returns partitions satisfying conditions.
* get_anonymize_dataset:
   * Creates anonymized dataset with numerical ranges and masked sensitive attributes.
   * Returns list of anonymized DataFrames.
* anonymize:
   * Reads dataset from CSV file.
   * Takes user input for K and L.
   * Calls partition_dataset and get_anonymize_dataset.
   * Writes anonymized datasets to text files.
Main Flow:
* Input Parameters:
   * filename: CSV file with the dataset.
   * User inputs for K and L values.
* Reading Data:
   * Reads dataset from CSV using pd.read_csv.
* Partitioning:
   * Calls partition_dataset for K-anonymity and L-diversity.
   * Handles categorical and numerical columns.
* Anonymization:
   * Calls get_anonymize_dataset for anonymized datasets.
   * Replaces numerical values, masks sensitive attributes.
* Output:
   * Writes anonymized datasets to text files (k_anonymity.txt, k_drawback.txt, median_problem.txt).
   * k_anonymity.txt: Anonymized dataset.
   * k_drawback.txt: Groups with same sensitive attribute values (for L=0 or 1).
   * median_problem.txt: Groups with size >= 2K.
* Runtime Calculation:
   * Calculates and prints runtime.
Notes:
* Supports K-anonymity and L-diversity.
* Sensitive Column,categorical columns,numerical columns should be mentioned in code according your dataset.
* Handles both categorical and numerical columns.
* Tracks merged categories in merged_categories.
* Anonymized datasets written to separate files.
Important:
* Success of K-anonymity depends on dataset and parameter choices (K, L).
